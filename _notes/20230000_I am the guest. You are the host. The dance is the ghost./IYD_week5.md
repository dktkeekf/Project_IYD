## About
In performance art, we often discuss the presence of the body. I became curious about the concept of the absence of the body. However, I realized that absence is an abstract concept that is difficult to articulate bodily, as we don't have physical reference of absence. 

I wrote about how the act of measuring can make absence more tangible. [[Measuring the distance between the absences]] This led me to wonder if this idea could be used as material for dance. 

"What is the negative dance?" This was my initial idea for week 5, where we delve the bodily movement from the idea of negative dance. 

[[Relative measurement]]




I organized the week's activities procedurally with  improvisation, writing, and discussion inspired by #Janne-Camila's experimental reflection (citation). At the end of the week, we produced four different scores that were developed by the dancers and shared with the audience.

#sulekhaomar highlights the distinction between front stage behaviour  (that are visible to 
audience) and backstage behaviour" and she gave me a reference : “PRESENTATION OF SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE.” by Erving Goffman 
[[Forming audience's understanding of the space by the performers presence.]]

Working with
[[The dance that could have been]]

I was thinking of creating

# 2023-02-02_Thursday_It... Rehearsal

### visitors
 #eirikhegre was talking about physics of light. I enjoyed his excitement when he explain about the light. And it gave me also the basic element of movement of light. 

 #jenniesteen came to show her costume. she mentioned she copy the way I work, and copy the clothes that the dances wears. I feel very happy, without needs for explain how I would like to work, there is some sort of synchronise. At the same time, I would love to develop our conversation in more deeper lever, but I don't know how.

### note during the rehearsal
- "We need to start with something"
- I found some need to change the way to produce the material next week. not for the sake of new. but for the sake of shift
- Making Manifesto with the idea of relative : [[Relative measurement]] 
**It is determined by in relation**

### #marlenebonnesen 's note

Words and expressions that I just encountered and that I somehow can relate to in relation to your work: 

... in the scheme of things

... I will start a new nuclear missile crisis with my emotions

... mayhem

  

And then I want to do a short dance warm up to this song tomorrow if there is time in the schedule: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcJm1pOswfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcJm1pOswfM)

# 2023-02-03_Friday_Work in progress
### 4 scores
[[The dance that could have been]]
[[It is in the edge]]
[[It can only exist because of you]]
[[It is not about me]]


### note
I want to make interview on #jenniesteen about costume as an documentation
[[The time does not always complement you]]
There was lack of clarification on score. when it became mush, it looses the meaning

### #Janne-Camila 

This made me think of you:

The horse, the robot and the immeasurable

### #theodorbarth 
I liked the way the floor was constituted from within and without to define the space before the props/objects were introduced. Also the costumes were such that they worked on the dance floor, but also could work for a kind of high end leisure at home. Perhaps also because the scores invited not a set choreography but a transindividual unfolding of rather difference dance-personalities.

### [['It' is determined by in-relation]]

---
# Map

Tool: naming, relative measuring
Method: collective score producing (inspired by #Janne-Camila )
Concept: negative entity of dance
Question: 
how to dance the impossible?, 
==how to produce the presence with the notion of negativity?,== 
what if the dance lingers?, 
what if the dance never disappears?
Score: It can only exist because of you, It is not about me, It could have been, it is on the edge
Statement: 'It' is determined by in-relation
Notation:  Perhaps the scores invited not a set choreography but a transindividual unfolding of rather difference dance-personalities.
Margins: Time doesn't always complement
