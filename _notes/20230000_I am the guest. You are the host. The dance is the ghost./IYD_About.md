## About
'I am the guest. You are the host. The dance is the ghost'(IYD) is a choreographic framework that focuses on how to hold space and time for the dance-making process and how to be together, and how to create space that invites collaborations. It suggests the production of methods and tools that constantly depend on who is collaborating, blurring the boundaries between stage and everyday living spaces. 

At IYD, production of different pieces of work can take place in a short period of time. The time frame consists of the five days of the week, Monday to Friday, each with its own agenda including physical warm-up and work tasks, guest and facilitators, inviting visitors to gain insight into the workings of the space, and redefining the role of collaboration within group creativity. Every Friday, there is a work in progress showcasing, and visitors are free to join in and critic the creative works and interdisciplinary approach of the participants. IYDâ€™s innovative program is a great opportunity for everyone interested in producing their ideas and creating something meaningful in a short period of time.
